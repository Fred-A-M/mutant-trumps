Mutant Trumps is a card game built with **React.js** and **JavaScript**, powered by **Vite**. In this game, Player 1 competes against the computer in a battle of mutant attributes. The goal is to strategically choose the attribute with the highest value to win the opponent's card. The game ends when one player collects all the cards.

## How to Play
Choose the size of the deck from the available options.

Player 1 goes first. On your turn, select an attribute (e.g., Size, Strength, or Intelligence) that you believe is higher than the computer's card for that attribute.

If your chosen attribute is higher than the computer's, you win the round and take the computer's card.

If the computer's attribute is higher, it takes your card.

Continue playing until one player has all the cards in the deck, winning the game.

## Game Rules
Turn-Based: Player 1 and the computer alternate turns.

Attribute Comparison: Each mutant card has three main attributes (e.g., Size, Strength, and Intelligence). The goal is to choose an attribute that you believe is stronger than the opponent’s.

Winning the Game: A player wins by taking all the other player’s cards.
